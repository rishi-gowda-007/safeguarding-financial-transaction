SecureTransact is a project designed to enhance the security of financial transactions by leveraging Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The system is built to detect potential fraudulent activities in real-time, ensuring the safe handling of sensitive financial data.

Features:
Fraud Detection Model: Implements an ANN-based model trained on transaction data to identify fraudulent patterns.
Dataset Integration: Uses an Excel dataset to train and validate the model.
Front-End Interface: A responsive web interface developed using HTML and CSS for users to interact with the system.
Real-Time Predictions: Provides quick and efficient predictions to flag potentially suspicious transactions.
Customizable Parameters: Users can adjust model parameters to refine the detection mechanism for their needs.

Technologies:
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Python (for model training and prediction)
HTML/CSS (for the front-end interface)
Pandas/Numpy (for dataset handling)
Excel (for dataset input)
